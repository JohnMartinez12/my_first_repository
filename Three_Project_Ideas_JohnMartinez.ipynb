    "(Preferred) [This](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/lego-database/data) dataset contains multiple csvs containing information on every official LEGO set ever released. I would have to join these csvs on certain columns to get a single, proper DataFrame, and with it, I would then analyze how LEGO sets have evolved over time in terms of theme, size, color, and parts. Have they gotten bigger, what certain themes have grown and/or died?"
